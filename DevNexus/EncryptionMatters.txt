Data Encryption Standards(DES)
  - NSA convinced IBM to reduce keysize to 56 bits
  - Changed the definition of 'S-Boxes'

Differential Cryptanalysis(DC)
  - An attack on block ciphers, stream ciphers, and hashing functions
  - How do changes in input affect output?
  -

Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)
  - Encrypt, Decrypt, Encrypt again
  - Key length of 168 bits

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
  - Developed by NIST between 1997 and 2000
  - Open process requesting designs
  - Wanted reasonable performance in variety of env
  - Rijndael was chosen in 2000
  - FIPS pub 197 accepted in 2001
  - Well-received by the crypto community
  - Not based on Feistel networks
  - Supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits
  - Between 10-14 rounds
  - SubBytes, shiftrows, mixColumns, AddRoundKey
  - Mostly side channel attacks coming in

Asymmetric Encryption
  - Diffie-Helman Key Exchange (DHKE)
      First published asymmetric crypto shceme 1976
  - Useful over untrusted channels but terrible with performance
  - uses: SSH, TLS, IPSec (generate keys/passwords etc)

Failures in Implementations:
  - Apple SecureTransport - 'Triple Handshake'
  - GNUTLS - Bad cert violation/MITM
  - OpenSSL - heartbleed (this is an open source project)
    - attached to a buffer overflow that went through secure validation
    - Someone checked the code and "missed a buffer overflow"
  - NSS - Signature forgery flaw(ASN.1 parsing)
  - Microsoft SChannel

Known TLS Hacks
  - BEAST
  - CRIME
  - BREACH
  - Lucky 13
  - POODLE
    - Simulate a failure during negotiation process
    - SSL3 is broken, so bytes of plain text and cookies get stolen

  Prevent TLS hacks
    - you have to use the updated browser version, which people oft don't do
    - Design failures can't be fixed during attacks
    - People should be removing SSL3
    - To not leak details, use Constant Time AES w/Caching
      (timing and power consumption give clues for decryption)

Symmetric key encryption does not survive well
  - modern places are using forward secrecy
  - ephemeral keys
  - https://weakdh.org
    - too many people are using the same 512bit
      prime number in their implementation
    - This becomes an easy way to backdoor a lot of internet traffic
  - BULLRUN
    - Edward Snowden - a rigorous attempt by US gov't to break crypto
    - Bullrun = Codename for NSA project to break crypto by any means possible
    - Hack servers to get keys
    - Influence policies, standards, and specification for commercial public key
    - NYT reports NSA has a huge budget for those efforts
  - Dual_EC_DRBG
    - Dual elliptic curve
    - PRNG algorithm
    - In 2007, concern about a backdoor
    - Required for FIPS 140-2
    - Problem: Break the PRNG everything else fails
      - TSL handshake requires 28 bytes of random data for session master secret
      - NSA paid RSA to make DualECDRBG default PRNG
  - RdRand
    - Intel instruction - engineers wanted to rely solely on
      rng sealed inside chip which is impossible to audit
    - OSS Support for RdRand

  FREAK of the Week
    - Factoring RSA Export Keys
    - SMACK variety
    - Legacy of export controls
    - Export version of clients
    - MITM attack against vulnerable clients
      - MITM changes standard RSA ciphersuite request to export request
      - OpenSSL/SecureTransport Bug
      - Attacker factors the RSA modulus to recover decryption key
    - FREAK server vulnerabilties everywhere
      - OpenSSL
      - BoringSSL
      - libReSSL
      - Safari, chrome, android, opera, blackberry, and
        ALL versions of windows = vulnerable
