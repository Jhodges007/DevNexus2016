We need to answer 2 big questions:

1. What is the browser doing?
2. How can we make our own tools?

In the rending agent "Blink" there are 7 million lines of code
  Chromium multiprocess architecture - chromium browser is open source proj
  Chrome canary
  Not a package mgr for Chromium so need to set up automated script for security
  patch downloads as it won't keep itself up to date
  KHTML -> Webkit(almost everyone) -> Blink(Chrome)

Rendering:
  Loading -> source text
  Parsing -> DOM tree
  attach()-> RenderObject Tree
  Style Resolution -> RenderStyles
  Layout -> Line Boxes, Layers

  youtube: Gecko reflow visualization of Wikipedia rendering
  have you heard of sizzle? If you use jquery, you probably use sizzle
    look at source code for jquery and sizzle

Bindings:
  Connect to your operating system
  JavaScript agent: Mozilla uses spider monkey for example
    V8 - compiles and executes JavaScript code
  Blink: inside Blink is "SKiA" - really good for web graphics

Tools:
  Extend existing tools
  Create your own modular tools and even libraries!
  Refine existing tools

Example of modular code:
  Object literal syntax provides a way to neatly
  organize a library with lots of functions
      **sidebar** you can add +spam to your email name before @ to direc
      everything from that site to spam
